# Pong
This pong game is my first project made using the turtle library of Python

The goal of this game is to not let the ball touch any wall parallel to the two paddles.
The left paddle can be controlled with s(down) and w(up).
The right paddle can be controlled by up and down arrow keys.
You can enjoy this game with your friend or even play it alone of you are like me XD.
